This is my personal `.ideavimrc` file that is very likely usuitable for anyone other than myself. Made for Swedish keyboards as the `รถ` key is used for Esc and `ร` for command mode.

Clone this repo as a new folder called `ideavimrc` in `%userprofile%` or `~` and put this in your actual `.ideavimrc`:

```.vimrc
source ~/ideavimrc/.vimrc
```

Space is the leader key.
Open the config with ` fed` and reload with ` frd` (file edit/reload dotfile).
