This is my personal `.ideavimrc` file that is very likely usuitable for anyone other than myself. Made for Swedish keyboards as the `รถ` key is used for Esc and `ร` for command mode.

Clone this repo as a new folder called `ideavimrc` in `%userprofile%` or `~` and put this in your actual `.ideavimrc`:

```.vimrc
source ~/ideavimrc/.vimrc
```

intellimacs is a depedency for this config and needs to also be cloned in `%userprofile%` as `.intellimacs`:
```.vimrc
git clone https://github.com/MarcoIeni/intellimacs .intellimacs
```

Space is the leader key.

Open the config with ` fer` and reload with ` feR`.
