This is my personal `.ideavimrc` file that is probably not suitable for usage for anyone other than me.

Clone this repo as a new folder called `ideavimrc` in `%userprofile%` or `~` and put this in your actual `.ideavimrc`:

```.vimrc
source ~/ideavimrc/.vimrc
```

Open the config with ` fed` and reload with ` frd` (file edit/reload dotfile).
